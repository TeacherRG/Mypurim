And the Jews confirmed and took upon themselves and upon their descendants and upon all who joined them, without fail, to observe these two days according to their prescription and at their appointed time every year. And these days of Purim shall not pass away from among the Jews, and their memory shall not perish from their descendants."

The Sages replied to her: \"You will arouse the envy of the nations against us,\" for the Megilla describes the victory of the Jews over the nations, and one should not provoke their hostility. She said to them: \"I am already written in the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia,\" meaning the event had already become known, and therefore it is fitting to establish it in Israel as well."

And he sent letters to all the Jews — to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus — words of peace and truth, to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed times, as Mordechai the Jew and Esther the queen had established for themselves, and as they had confirmed upon themselves and upon their descendants with ordinances of fasting and lamentation. And the word of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book."

Therefore Mordechai asked the queen to write and send a second letter to the Jews, for her authority would have greater impact. The proof of this is that it says: \"And the word of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim\" — for had it not been for her word, the enactment might have been forgotten."
